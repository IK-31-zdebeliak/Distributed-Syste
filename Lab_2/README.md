### Hello World ###


To launch my 'Hello World' project in file lab_1.py, just double click on lab_1.bat file in this directory.

To launch my Bonus project in file bonus.py, just double click on bonus.bat file in this directory.

This file can understand and execute such commands, as: echo, ping, dir and exit.
Firstly, you must input command, press 'Enter' and input command parameter in the second line. If your command doesn't have parameters, skip this line.

Command 'list' from instruction was replaced by 'dir' command, because Windows cmd doesn't have 'list' command.
